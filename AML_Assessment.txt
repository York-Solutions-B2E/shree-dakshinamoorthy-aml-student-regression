Regression Analysis on Student Grades:
We are an educational consultancy company interested in understanding factors that influence student performance.
We are looking for a regression model to predict the final grades of students based on a vast array of personal and socio-economic factors.
Accurate predictions can help in identifying students who might need additional support. We have the data in a CSV format exported from Excel,
but we would like this transferred to a local Postgres database. Additionally, we require a python function that can add a new student to the database.

Requests:
- Perform EDA with visualizations to assist in feature selection and engineering
- Convert the CSV to a Postgres database and create a python function to easily add new
students to the Postgres database. Ensure the database schema has appropriate
datatypes.
- Selection and/or engineer the feature set you will use for your model
- Select and train a model to predict the final grade of a student.
- Tune the model to get the best results possible
- Generate valid metrics to evaluate your model

Additional Requests (Bonus):
- Create another model that predicts final grades without using any of the previous period grades. 
This would be immensely helpful to the company to aid in predicting student performance before they fall behind
- Write a full Data Analysis report on the statistics gleaned from the dataset
- Include documentation used to plan out this project and its timeline.

Requirements:
- All code shall be written in python or SQL
- All code shall be managed via git
- The repository shall be named ‘<first_name>-<last_name>-aml-student-regression' (all
lowercase, i.e. Tom Cruise’s repository name is ‘tom-cruise-aml-capstone')
- Only libraries inherent to python or listed below can be used
- The Postgres database should be managed via docker
- Only data from the given dataset will be used

Allowed Dependencies
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib - seaborn

psycopg2
sqlalchemy

This capstone is due 1/22/2024. Ensure you use your time to optimize the performance of each step in creating your model.
The dataset and dataset description will be provided in ‘assessment_1.zip’
