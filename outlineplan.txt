Project Title: Student Performance Regression Analysis

The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict student performance 

postgre connection -explore
create database
add table 
add new student data

Explore and understand the data structure, features, and relationships.
Handle missing or inconsistent data.


Perform data cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers.
Feature engineering: create new features if needed.
Encode categorical variables and standardize/normalize numerical variables.

EDA
Visualize and analyze the distribution of target variable (student performance).
Explore relationships between features and the target variable.
Identify potential correlations and patterns.

Feature Selection:
explore selectkbest
Evaluate and select the most relevant features.

Model Selection:
Choose regression models suitable for the problem (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression).
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Model Training:
Train selected models using the training dataset.
Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
Evaluate models using cross-validation.

 Model Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance on the testing dataset.
Find Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Relative Error.

Documentation and Reporting:
Document the entire process, including data preprocessing steps, model selection , results.
